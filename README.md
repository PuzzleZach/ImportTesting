# ImportTesting
Demonstrating intra-package imports in Python3 as seen in [my blog post](https://puzzlezach.github.io/resolving-imports-python).

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/PuzzleZach/ImportTesting.git`
2. Go outside of this directory and run `python3 -m ImportTesting.TestDriver` to understand how intra-package imports work.

This is a quick setup to show how we might call libraries from a different folder and test that they are successfully importing their functions.
